#This project is a computational tool designed to aid in the exploration of peptide-protein interactions, specifically between E-Cadherin and KLRG-1. By generating and analyzing these peptide variants, researchers can identify which amino acid substitutions maintain or enhance binding affinity. This work is foundational for developing synthetic peptides that could modulate immune responses or serve as therapeutic agents.
